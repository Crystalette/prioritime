        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>Prioritime is a web-based platform that enables users to intuitively organize their tasks that need to be completed for the day, based on the ability to import their google calendar data as well as integrating with their university learning platform,
            to be able to help individuals make better use of their time and make smarter decisions that is tailored to their current academic process in school.

        <h2>Designed For Students</h2>
        <p> We realized that one of the biggest headaches for students is figuring out what their priorities should be - whether it be working on a group project, or which course to study for first. Poor time management and planning results in bad grades,
            which is very discouraging and frustrating. With Prioritime, the system would be able to suggest activities based on machine learning algorithms on what to do first, based on the course number, the year of study, length of each class, and
            the frequency. The integration with google calendars will also extract personal tasks and appointments, and will suggest to the user what to focus on first on that specific day.

                <h3>Lack of Transparency</h3>
                <p>Instructors sometimes do not give a full overview of how students are progressing in their courses, and grade transparency is something that is lacking for many school systems. Students are not able to know their grades til the end of
                    the term

                <h3>Progress Tracking</h3>
                <p>
                    When working on a project, students lack the tools to be able to track their progress when working with a team, as many tasks are dispersed across different people. Prioritime allows individual tracking so that students can focus on what they can complete,
                    on time.

                <p>School isnâ€™t everything, which is why Prioritime integrates with google calendar to extract non-school tasks and data as well. Prioritime will be able to give reminders on upcoming appointments and whether they will collide with project
                    due dates, and give suggestions on which projects to complete first to give users room to breathe</p>
